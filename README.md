# i3 dotfiles
These are my i3 dotfiles.
Here is a screenshot:

If you'd like to try it out, here are the tools directly used:

- rofi - menus
- i3-gaps - Nicer looking fork of i3
- compton - Composite effects (mostly fades and inactive opacity)
- i3lock - Lock screen
- scrot - Lock screen
- imagick (for the convert tool) - Lock screen
- awk - Lock screen
- nm-applet - (Optional) NetworkManager tray applet 
- unity-settings-daemon - (Optional) Unity settings for keychains, GTK opts etc
- variety - Wallpaper downloader
- pactl - Volume keys binding
- xbacklight - Backlight control

Keybindings are slightly tweaked from defaults because I'm an ex WMII monkey:
- $mod - Mod4 (Windows key)
- Program menu: $mod+p
- Close window: $mod+shift+c
- $mod-space: Rofi mode (usually toggle between float + tile focus)
- Reload config: $mod+shift+z
- $mod-Pause: Power menu mode (logoff, lock, suspend etc)
- $mod-shift-bracketleft - (Square bracket) Move workspace to output to left
- $mod-shift-bracketright - (Square bracket) Move workspace to output to right
